// This example reruns the step-3 attack against the full content-side stack
// with the payload written in Morse code. Same intent, same request, same
// defenses; only the alphabet changed, so none of the words the blocklist
// matches are present as text.
//
// Every content-side defense is on and nothing structural is. One claim,
// isolated: watch what each filter does with a message that has no keyword
// in it.
//
// # Running the example:
//
//	$ make example15-step6
//
// # Watch the data arrive - run this in a second terminal FIRST:
//
//	$ make example15-attacker
//
// # This requires running the following commands:
//
//	$ make compose-up
//	$ make kronk-up

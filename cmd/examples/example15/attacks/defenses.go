// injection, they are all shipped by real systems, and step 6 defeats every one
// of them with a payload that means the same thing spelled differently.

// metadata, on the shape of a tool's schema, on who the caller is, and on where
// a socket is pointed. An attacker rewriting their payload has nothing to aim
// at, because nothing in the payload is what these consult.

// The system prompt.
// =============================================================================

// BaseSystemPrompt is the vulnerable baseline, used by every scenario. Keeping
// it constant is what makes the matrix a controlled experiment: the framing
// never moves, so a difference between cells is attributable to the defense and
// nothing else.
//
// It is vulnerable on purpose, and specifically at step 2 of the workflow, which
// instructs the model to act on directives found in retrieved documents. That
// single line is the entire indirect-injection vulnerability, and it is a line
// real RAG system prompts write without noticing they have written it.
//
// Note what is NOT here: any list of tools, and any instruction about how to
// call one. The tools are sent with every request as structured definitions, so
// the model knows them without being told twice. A design that depends on the
// attacker not knowing a tool name has no defense at all - the name is on the
// wire.
//
// Also note what is not here any more: `/no_think`. It used to be, and it
// quietly broke step 6. Suppressing the reasoning block costs the model the
// step-by-step work that decoding an encoded payload requires, so the attack
// failed for a reason that had nothing to do with any defense - the model never
// got far enough to be vulnerable. A model that cannot think is not a model
// anyone ships, and it is not one worth attacking in a workshop either.

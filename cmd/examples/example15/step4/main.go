// This example changes the door the payload comes through. Steps 2 and 3 had it
// typed by the attacker or carried by a document; here it arrives as the output
// of a tool the model chose to call on its own.
//
// Three parts:
//
//  1. The shell tool called directly with hardcoded arguments and no model in
//     the picture, so the unsafe contract is visible before anyone can blame the
//     model for being fooled.
//
//  2. A compromised weather API appends instructions to its response. The user
//     asked about the weather in Miami, there is no document store, and tool
//     output re-enters the conversation as prompt.
//
//  3. The obvious fix: blocklist the tool output. It works here, and it is the
//     same class of defense step 6 walks through.
//
// # Running the example:
//
//	$ make example15-step4
//
// # This requires running the following commands:
//
//	$ make kronk-up
//
// No database is needed: there is no retrieval anywhere in this step, which is
// itself part of the lesson.

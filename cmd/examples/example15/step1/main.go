// This example is reconnaissance: the attacker asks the assistant to describe
// its own tools, their parameters and its system prompt. Nothing leaves and no
// rule is broken, but every later step needs to know tool_browse exists, and
// this is where that is handed over.
//
// Tool definitions go to the model as structured data on every request, so the
// name was never a secret to begin with.
//
// # Running the example:
//
//	$ make example15-step1
//
// # This requires running the following commands:
//
//	$ make kronk-up
//
// No database is needed for this step.

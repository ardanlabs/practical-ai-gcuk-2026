// This example exfiltrates the same confidential record to the same attacker
// endpoint twice, with nothing in the way. Only the delivery differs:
//
//   - Direct: the attacker types the instructions into the chat box.
//   - Indirect: the attacker writes one comment into the document store, and
//     retrieval carries it into a real user's conversation later.
//
// The second is why RAG changes the threat model. The attacker is not in the
// conversation, was never authenticated to it, and may have poisoned the store
// months earlier.
//
// # Running the example:
//
//	$ make example15-step2
//
// # Watch the data arrive - run this in a second terminal FIRST:
//
//	$ go run ./cmd/examples/example15/attacker
//
// # This requires running the following commands:
//
//	$ make compose-up
//	$ make kronk-up
